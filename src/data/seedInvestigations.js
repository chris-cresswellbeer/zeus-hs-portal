    summary:"Forklift operator reversed in Warehouse Bay 2 without checking nearside mirror. A pedestrian was crossing behind the vehicle and narrowly avoided contact. The driver was unaware the pedestrian was present. The incident occurred during a shift changeover when foot traffic in the bay was higher than normal.",
    rootCause:"Inadequate segregation of pedestrian and vehicle routes in Warehouse Bay 2. No physical barrier or clearly marked crossing point. The driver had not conducted a pre-operation mirror check as required by the site traffic management plan.",
    contributingFactors:"Shift changeover resulted in increased pedestrian activity in the bay. Bay 2 reversing mirrors were positioned poorly due to racking layout changes in Q4 2023. No visual warning system (flashing light/horn protocol) was in routine use.",
    immediateActions:"Vehicle stopped immediately and operator debriefed. Bay access restricted to essential personnel while assessment was carried out. All forklift operators reminded of mirror check procedure via toolbox talk.",
    recommendations:"Install physical pedestrian segregation barriers in Bay 2. Add audible reverse alarms to all counterbalance trucks not currently fitted. Introduce formal pre-start mirror check into daily vehicle inspection sheet.",

    summary:"Tom Bradley slipped on an icy step at the Loading Dock entrance at approximately 07:20 on 5 February 2024. Temperatures overnight had dropped to -3°C. The gritting rota had not been completed before the early shift started. Tom sustained a bruised knee and was assessed by the first aider. He returned to light duties the same day.",
    rootCause:"The site gritting rota did not assign responsibility for the dock entrance steps. Gritting was focused on the main car park and yard. The steps, which are in shadow and freeze earlier than surrounding areas, were not included in the gritting schedule.",
    contributingFactors:"Unusually cold snap forecast was not communicated to the facilities team. No anti-slip tape on dock steps. Steps are metal and particularly susceptible to ice. Early start workers arrive before facilities team completes morning grit round.",
    immediateActions:"Area gritted and salted immediately. Steps cordoned off until safe. Tom assessed by first aider — bruised knee, no hospital treatment required. Incident reported on accident register.",
    recommendations:"Update gritting rota to include dock entrance steps as a priority zone. Apply anti-slip tape to all dock step nosings. Introduce a winter weather trigger protocol: when forecast < 2°C, out-of-hours grit to be completed before first shift.",

    summary:"Priya Sharma reported a leaking pipe under the sink in Staff Toilets Block B on 17 January 2024. Standing water had accumulated on the tile floor, creating a slip risk. The leak had been present for an estimated 24 hours before being reported — staff had noticed it but not formally logged it, unsure whether it warranted an incident report or a facilities request.",
    rootCause:"No clear protocol distinguishing between a safety-reportable unsafe condition and a routine facilities request. Staff perceived the incident reporting system as being for serious accidents only, which delayed reporting.",
    contributingFactors:"Incident reporting culture did not extend to minor defects. Block B toilets were not on the daily facilities walkround route. The leak had been visible to multiple staff members before formal escalation.",
    immediateActions:"Area cordoned off with wet floor signs. Facilities contacted — pipe repaired within 3 hours. Floor dried and signs removed. Staff reminded that standing water is a reportable unsafe condition.",

    summary:"Sophie Clarke reported that Fire Exit C had been wedged open with a pallet on 13 March 2024. Staff had propped the exit to allow a two-person carrying task without repeatedly opening the door. This created a dual risk: breach of fire compartmentation and a potential obstruction to the escape route.",
    rootCause:"Staff were using fire exits as convenient thoroughfares for carrying tasks rather than using the designated service doors, which required a 40-metre detour. No awareness of the legal consequences of propping fire exits.",
    contributingFactors:"Service door routing was inconvenient for cross-building carries. No clear prohibition signage on fire exits. Previous fire door toolbox talk was 18 months prior.",

A colleague was working below and was narrowly missed. The tool fell approximately 3 metres. No exclusion zone had been established beneath the platform.",
    rootCause:"The workshop at-height risk assessment focused on fall prevention for the operative but did not address falling object risk to personnel below. No formal procedure required an exclusion zone under elevated work.",
    contributingFactors:"No tool tethering or tool bag used on the platform. No barriers or signage below platform during elevated work. Workshop at-height risk assessment last reviewed 2021.",

    summary:"James Okafor was operating a counterbalance truck in Warehouse Bay 5 when Ryan Fitzgerald stepped from a racking aisle directly into the vehicle path. James braked and stopped within 0.5 metres. This was the second forklift/pedestrian near-miss in Bay 5 in 6 months. Convex mirrors recommended after i2401 had not been installed at Bay 5.",
    rootCause:"The racking aisle opening in Bay 5 had no convex mirror or visual warning. Pedestrians stepping out had no ability to see oncoming trucks. The traffic management plan showed a segregated pedestrian route, but no physical barrier enforced it.",
    contributingFactors:"Second near-miss at this specific location in 6 months. Corrective action (mirrors) from i2401 was incomplete — Bay 5 not covered. Pedestrian route marking existed but was not enforced.",
    immediateActions:"Operations paused. Both individuals spoken to. Emergency briefing on pedestrian/vehicle separation. Physical crossing point at Bay 5 blocked with temporary barriers pending permanent solution.",

    summary:"Daniel Okonkwo accessed the roof via the plant room hatch on 14 August 2024 without a harness or work-at-height permit, spending 25 minutes on the roof investigating a leak. He believed a brief inspection did not require formal controls. A contractor observed the activity and reported it to the H&S team.",
    rootCause:"The work-at-height policy referred to 'work' at height without clarifying that visual inspections were included. Daniel had informal access to the roof hatch key without a permit process.",
    contributingFactors:"Policy ambiguity on what constitutes work at height. Previous roof inspections had been carried out informally without incident. Fall arrest kit was stored in a locked maintenance office cabinet rather than at the hatch.",

The area had been noted as slippery in October's facilities report but no action had been taken and no owner or timeline had been assigned.",
    rootCause:"Facilities report items for outdoor surface defects had no priority classification, no owner assignment, and no completion timeline. The moss hazard was not treated as safety-critical.",
    contributingFactors:"No outdoor surface defect priority matrix. Shaded yard section excluded from cleaning rota. Facilities report item not escalated.",

The operative had received a general site induction but no area-specific induction for the Packaging Hall before being deployed there.",
    rootCause:"The area-specific induction for the Packaging Hall had not been completed before deployment. The general induction did not cover the specific machine hazards and pedestrian routes in the hall. No formal record of area inductions existed.",
    contributingFactors:"Area induction system was informal and reliant on line manager memory. Production pressure resulted in early deployment to the production area. New starter sign-off sheet did not track area inductions.",

    rootCause:"Despite physical improvements and toolbox talks from previous incidents, James continued to reverse without mirror checks. His forklift licence renewal was overdue and competence had not been formally re-assessed.",
    contributingFactors:"No system alert for overdue forklift licence renewals. Physical controls had reduced but not eliminated the risk. Three near-misses in 12 months for the same operator indicated a competence and attitude issue.",
